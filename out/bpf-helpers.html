<h1 class="subtitle">list of eBPF helper functions</h1>
</div>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) subsystem consists in programs written in a pseudo-assembly language, then attached to one of the several kernel hooks and run in reaction of specific events. This framework differs from the older, “classic” BPF (or “cBPF”) in several aspects, one of them being the ability to call special functions (or “helpers”) from within a program. These functions are restricted to a white-list of helpers defined in the kernel.</p>
<p>These helpers are used by eBPF programs to interact with the system, or with the context in which they work. For instance, they can be used to print debugging messages, to get the time since the system was booted, to interact with eBPF maps, or to manipulate network packets. Since there are several eBPF program types, and that they do not run in the same context, each program type can only call a subset of those helpers.</p>
<p>Due to eBPF conventions, a helper can not have more than five arguments.</p>
<p>Internally, eBPF programs call directly into the compiled helper functions without requiring any foreign-function interface. As a result, calling helpers introduces no overhead, thus offering excellent performance.</p>
<p>This document is an attempt to list and document the helpers available to eBPF developers. They are sorted by chronological order (the oldest helpers in the kernel at the top).</p>

<dt><strong>int bpf_trace_printk(const char *</strong><em>fmt</em><strong>, u32</strong> <em>fmt_size</em><strong>, …)</strong></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>This helper is a “printk()-like” facility for debugging. It prints a message defined by format <em>fmt</em> (of size <em>fmt_size</em>) to file <em>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace</em> from DebugFS, if available. It can take up to three additional <strong>u64</strong> arguments (as an eBPF helpers, the total number of arguments is limited to five).</p>
<p>Each time the helper is called, it appends a line to the trace. The format of the trace is customizable, and the exact output one will get depends on the options set in <em>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_options</em> (see also the <em>README</em> file under the same directory). However, it usually defaults to something like:</p>
<pre><code>telnet-470   [001] .N.. 419421.045894: 0x00000001: &lt;formatted msg&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In the above:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>telnet</code> is the name of the current task.</li>
<li><code>470</code> is the PID of the current task.</li>
<li><code>001</code> is the CPU number on which the task is running.</li>
<li>In <code>.N..</code>, each character refers to a set of options (whether irqs are enabled, scheduling options, whether hard/softirqs are running, level of preempt_disabled respectively). <strong>N</strong> means that <strong>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</strong> and <strong>PREEMPT_NEED_RESCHED</strong> are set.</li>
<li><code>419421.045894</code> is a timestamp.</li>
<li><code>0x00000001</code> is a fake value used by BPF for the instruction pointer register.</li>
<li><code>&lt;formatted msg&gt;</code> is the message formatted with <em>fmt</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The conversion specifiers supported by <em>fmt</em> are similar, but more limited than for printk(). They are <strong>%d</strong>, <strong>%i</strong>, <strong>%u</strong>, <strong>%x</strong>, <strong>%ld</strong>, <strong>%li</strong>, <strong>%lu</strong>, <strong>%lx</strong>, <strong>%lld</strong>, <strong>%lli</strong>, <strong>%llu</strong>, <strong>%llx</strong>, <strong>%p</strong>, <strong>%s</strong>. No modifier (size of field, padding with zeroes, etc.) is available, and the helper will return <strong>-EINVAL</strong> (but print nothing) if it encounters an unknown specifier.</p>
<p>Also, note that <strong>bpf_trace_printk</strong>() is slow, and should only be used for debugging purposes. For this reason, a notice bloc (spanning several lines) is printed to kernel logs and states that the helper should not be used “for production use” the first time this helper is used (or more precisely, when <strong>trace_printk</strong>() buffers are allocated). For passing values to user space, perf events should be preferred.</p>

<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Get a pseudo-random number.</p>
<p>From a security point of view, this helper uses its own pseudo-random internal state, and cannot be used to infer the seed of other random functions in the kernel. However, it is essential to note that the generator used by the helper is not cryptographically secure.</p>

<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Store <em>len</em> bytes from address <em>from</em> into the packet associated to <em>skb</em>, at <em>offset</em>. <em>flags</em> are a combination of <strong>BPF_F_RECOMPUTE_CSUM</strong> (automatically recompute the checksum for the packet after storing the bytes) and <strong>BPF_F_INVALIDATE_HASH</strong> (set <em>skb</em><strong>-&gt;hash</strong>, <em>skb</em><strong>-&gt;swhash</strong> and <em>skb</em><strong>-&gt;l4hash</strong> to 0).</p>
<p>A call to this helper is susceptible to change the underlaying packet buffer. Therefore, at load time, all checks on pointers previously done by the verifier are invalidated and must be performed again, if the helper is used in combination with direct packet access.</p>

<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Recompute the layer 3 (e.g. IP) checksum for the packet associated to <em>skb</em>. Computation is incremental, so the helper must know the former value of the header field that was modified (<em>from</em>), the new value of this field (<em>to</em>), and the number of bytes (2 or 4) for this field, stored in <em>size</em>. Alternatively, it is possible to store the difference between the previous and the new values of the header field in <em>to</em>, by setting <em>from</em> and <em>size</em> to 0. For both methods, <em>offset</em> indicates the location of the IP checksum within the packet.</p>
<p>This helper works in combination with <strong>bpf_csum_diff</strong>(), which does not update the checksum in-place, but offers more flexibility and can handle sizes larger than 2 or 4 for the checksum to update.</p>

<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Recompute the layer 4 (e.g. TCP, UDP or ICMP) checksum for the packet associated to <em>skb</em>. Computation is incremental, so the helper must know the former value of the header field that was modified (<em>from</em>), the new value of this field (<em>to</em>), and the number of bytes (2 or 4) for this field, stored on the lowest four bits of <em>flags</em>. Alternatively, it is possible to store the difference between the previous and the new values of the header field in <em>to</em>, by setting <em>from</em> and the four lowest bits of <em>flags</em> to 0. For both methods, <em>offset</em> indicates the location of the IP checksum within the packet. In addition to the size of the field, <em>flags</em> can be added (bitwise OR) actual flags. With <strong>BPF_F_MARK_MANGLED_0</strong>, a null checksum is left untouched (unless <strong>BPF_F_MARK_ENFORCE</strong> is added as well), and for updates resulting in a null checksum the value is set to <strong>CSUM_MANGLED_0</strong> instead. Flag <strong>BPF_F_PSEUDO_HDR</strong> indicates the checksum is to be computed against a pseudo-header.</p>
<p>This helper works in combination with <strong>bpf_csum_diff</strong>(), which does not update the checksum in-place, but offers more flexibility and can handle sizes larger than 2 or 4 for the checksum to update.</p>

<dt><strong>int bpf_tail_call(void *</strong><em>ctx</em><strong>, struct bpf_map *</strong><em>prog_array_map</em><strong>, u32</strong> <em>index</em><strong>)</strong></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>This special helper is used to trigger a “tail call”, or in other words, to jump into another eBPF program. The same stack frame is used (but values on stack and in registers for the caller are not accessible to the callee). This mechanism allows for program chaining, either for raising the maximum number of available eBPF instructions, or to execute given programs in conditional blocks. For security reasons, there is an upper limit to the number of successive tail calls that can be performed.</p>
<p>Upon call of this helper, the program attempts to jump into a program referenced at index <em>index</em> in <em>prog_array_map</em>, a special map of type <strong>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY</strong>, and passes <em>ctx</em>, a pointer to the context.</p>
<p>If the call succeeds, the kernel immediately runs the first instruction of the new program. This is not a function call, and it never returns to the previous program. If the call fails, then the helper has no effect, and the caller continues to run its subsequent instructions. A call can fail if the destination program for the jump does not exist (i.e. <em>index</em> is superior to the number of entries in <em>prog_array_map</em>), or if the maximum number of tail calls has been reached for this chain of programs. This limit is defined in the kernel by the macro <strong>MAX_TAIL_CALL_CNT</strong> (not accessible to user space), which is currently set to 32.</p>

<dt><strong>int bpf_clone_redirect(struct sk_buff *</strong><em>skb</em><strong>, u32</strong> <em>ifindex</em><strong>, u64</strong> <em>flags</em><strong>)</strong></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Clone and redirect the packet associated to <em>skb</em> to another net device of index <em>ifindex</em>. Both ingress and egress interfaces can be used for redirection. The <strong>BPF_F_INGRESS</strong> value in <em>flags</em> is used to make the distinction (ingress path is selected if the flag is present, egress path otherwise). This is the only flag supported for now.</p>
<p>In comparison with <strong>bpf_redirect</strong>() helper, <strong>bpf_clone_redirect</strong>() has the associated cost of duplicating the packet buffer, but this can be executed out of the eBPF program. Conversely, <strong>bpf_redirect</strong>() is more efficient, but it is handled through an action code where the redirection happens only after the eBPF program has returned.</p>
<p>A call to this helper is susceptible to change the underlaying packet buffer. Therefore, at load time, all checks on pointers previously done by the verifier are invalidated and must be performed again, if the helper is used in combination with direct packet access.</p>

<dd><p>Copy the <strong>comm</strong> attribute of the current task into <em>buf</em> of <em>size_of_buf</em>. The <strong>comm</strong> attribute contains the name of the executable (excluding the path) for the current task. The <em>size_of_buf</em> must be strictly positive.

<dd><p>Retrieve the classid for the current task, i.e. for the net_cls cgroup to which <em>skb</em> belongs.</p>
<p>This helper can be used on TC egress path, but not on ingress.</p>
<p>The net_cls cgroup provides an interface to tag network packets based on a user-provided identifier for all traffic coming from the tasks belonging to the related cgroup. See also the related kernel documentation, available from the Linux sources in file <em>Documentation/cgroup-v1/net_cls.txt</em>.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel has two versions for cgroups: there are cgroups v1 and cgroups v2. Both are available to users, who can use a mixture of them, but note that the net_cls cgroup is for cgroup v1 only. This makes it incompatible with BPF programs run on cgroups, which is a cgroup-v2-only feature (a socket can only hold data for one version of cgroups at a time).</p>
<p>This helper is only available is the kernel was compiled with the <strong>CONFIG_CGROUP_NET_CLASSID</strong> configuration option set to “<strong>y</strong>” or to “<strong>m</strong>”.</p>

<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Get tunnel metadata. This helper takes a pointer <em>key</em> to an empty <strong>struct bpf_tunnel_key</strong> of <strong>size</strong>, that will be filled with tunnel metadata for the packet associated to <em>skb</em>. The <em>flags</em> can be set to <strong>BPF_F_TUNINFO_IPV6</strong>, which indicates that the tunnel is based on IPv6 protocol instead of IPv4.</p>
<p>The <strong>struct bpf_tunnel_key</strong> is an object that generalizes the principal parameters used by various tunneling protocols into a single struct. This way, it can be used to easily make a decision based on the contents of the encapsulation header, “summarized” in this struct. In particular, it holds the IP address of the remote end (IPv4 or IPv6, depending on the case) in <em>key</em><strong>-&gt;remote_ipv4</strong> or <em>key</em><strong>-&gt;remote_ipv6</strong>. Also, this struct exposes the <em>key</em><strong>-&gt;tunnel_id</strong>, which is generally mapped to a VNI (Virtual Network Identifier), making it programmable together with the <strong>bpf_skb_set_tunnel_key</strong>() helper.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that the following code is part of a program attached to the TC ingress interface, on one end of a GRE tunnel, and is supposed to filter out all messages coming from remote ends with IPv4 address other than 10.0.0.1:</p>
<pre><code>int ret;
struct bpf_tunnel_key key = {};

ret = bpf_skb_get_tunnel_key(skb, &amp;key, sizeof(key), 0);
if (ret &lt; 0)
    return TC_ACT_SHOT; // drop packet

if (key.remote_ipv4 != 0x0a000001)
    return TC_ACT_SHOT; // drop packet

return TC_ACT_OK;       // accept packet</code></pre>
<p>This interface can also be used with all encapsulation devices that can operate in “collect metadata” mode: instead of having one network device per specific configuration, the “collect metadata” mode only requires a single device where the configuration can be extracted from this helper.</p>
<p>This can be used together with various tunnels such as VXLan, Geneve, GRE or IP in IP (IPIP).</p>

<dt><strong>u64 bpf_perf_event_read(struct bpf_map *</strong><em>map</em><strong>, u64</strong> <em>flags</em><strong>)</strong></dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Read the value of a perf event counter. This helper relies on a <em>map</em> of type <strong>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY</strong>. The nature of the perf event counter is selected when <em>map</em> is updated with perf event file descriptors. The <em>map</em> is an array whose size is the number of available CPUs, and each cell contains a value relative to one CPU. The value to retrieve is indicated by <em>flags</em>, that contains the index of the CPU to look up, masked with <strong>BPF_F_INDEX_MASK</strong>. Alternatively, <em>flags</em> can be set to <strong>BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU</strong> to indicate that the value for the current CPU should be retrieved.</p>
<p>Note that before Linux 4.13, only hardware perf event can be retrieved.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that the newer helper <strong>bpf_perf_event_read_value</strong>() is recommended over <strong>bpf_perf_event_read</strong>() in general. The latter has some ABI quirks where error and counter value are used as a return code (which is wrong to do since ranges may overlap). This issue is fixed with <strong>bpf_perf_event_read_value</strong>(), which at the same time provides more features over the <strong>bpf_perf_event_read</strong>() interface. Please refer to the description of <strong>bpf_perf_event_read_value</strong>() for details.</p>

The <strong>BPF_F_INGRESS</strong> value in <em>flags</em> is used to make the distinction (ingress path is selected if the flag is present, egress path otherwise).

<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Retrieve the realm or the route, that is to say the <strong>tclassid</strong> field of the destination for the <em>skb</em>. The indentifier retrieved is a user-provided tag, similar to the one used with the net_cls cgroup (see description for <strong>bpf_get_cgroup_classid</strong>() helper), but here this tag is held by a route (a destination entry), not by a task.</p>
<p>Retrieving this identifier works with the clsact TC egress hook (see also <strong>tc-bpf(8)</strong>), or alternatively on conventional classful egress qdiscs, but not on TC ingress path. In case of clsact TC egress hook, this has the advantage that, internally, the destination entry has not been dropped yet in the transmit path. Therefore, the destination entry does not need to be artificially held via <strong>netif_keep_dst</strong>() for a classful qdisc until the <em>skb</em> is freed.</p>
<p>This helper is available only if the kernel was compiled with <strong>CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_CLASSID</strong> configuration option.</p>

<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Write raw <em>data</em> blob into a special BPF perf event held by <em>map</em> of type <strong>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY</strong>. This perf event must have the following attributes: <strong>PERF_SAMPLE_RAW</strong> as <strong>sample_type</strong>, <strong>PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE</strong> as <strong>type</strong>, and <strong>PERF_COUNT_SW_BPF_OUTPUT</strong> as <strong>config</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>flags</em> are used to indicate the index in <em>map</em> for which the value must be put, masked with <strong>BPF_F_INDEX_MASK</strong>. Alternatively, <em>flags</em> can be set to <strong>BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU</strong> to indicate that the index of the current CPU core should be used.</p>
<p>The value to write, of <em>size</em>, is passed through eBPF stack and pointed by <em>data</em>.</p>
<p>The context of the program <em>ctx</em> needs also be passed to the helper.</p>
<p>On user space, a program willing to read the values needs to call <strong>perf_event_open</strong>() on the perf event (either for one or for all CPUs) and to store the file descriptor into the <em>map</em>. This must be done before the eBPF program can send data into it. An example is available in file <em>samples/bpf/trace_output_user.c</em> in the Linux kernel source tree (the eBPF program counterpart is in <em>samples/bpf/trace_output_kern.c</em>).</p>
<p><strong>bpf_perf_event_output</strong>() achieves better performance than <strong>bpf_trace_printk</strong>() for sharing data with user space, and is much better suitable for streaming data from eBPF programs.</p>
<p>Note that this helper is not restricted to tracing use cases and can be used with programs attached to TC or XDP as well, where it allows for passing data to user space listeners. Data can be:</p>

<dd><p>This helper was provided as an easy way to load data from a packet. It can be used to load <em>len</em> bytes from <em>offset</em> from the packet associated to <em>skb</em>, into the buffer pointed by <em>to</em>.</p>
<p>Since Linux 4.7, usage of this helper has mostly been replaced by “direct packet access”, enabling packet data to be manipulated with <em>skb</em><strong>-&gt;data</strong> and <em>skb</em><strong>-&gt;data_end</strong> pointing respectively to the first byte of packet data and to the byte after the last byte of packet data.

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Walk a user or a kernel stack and return its id. To achieve this, the helper needs <em>ctx</em>, which is a pointer to the context on which the tracing program is executed, and a pointer to a <em>map</em> of type <strong>BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE</strong>.</p>
<p>The last argument, <em>flags</em>, holds the number of stack frames to skip (from 0 to 255), masked with <strong>BPF_F_SKIP_FIELD_MASK</strong>. The next bits can be used to set a combination of the following flags:</p>

<p>For walking a stack, this helper is an improvement over <strong>bpf_probe_read</strong>(), which can be used with unrolled loops but is not efficient and consumes a lot of eBPF instructions. Instead, <strong>bpf_get_stackid</strong>() can collect up to <strong>PERF_MAX_STACK_DEPTH</strong> both kernel and user frames. Note that this limit can be controlled with the <strong>sysctl</strong> program, and that it should be manually increased in order to profile long user stacks (such as stacks for Java programs). To do so, use:</p>

<p>This helper is only needed for reading and writing with direct packet access.</p>
<p>For direct packet access, testing that offsets to access are within packet boundaries (test on <em>skb</em><strong>-&gt;data_end</strong>) is susceptible to fail if offsets are invalid, or if the requested data is in non-linear parts of the <em>skb</em>. On failure the program can just bail out, or in the case of a non-linear buffer, use a helper to make the data available. The <strong>bpf_skb_load_bytes</strong>() helper is a first solution to access the data. Another one consists in using <strong>bpf_skb_pull_data</strong> to pull in once the non-linear parts, then retesting and eventually access the data.</p>
<p>At the same time, this also makes sure the <em>skb</em> is uncloned, which is a necessary condition for direct write. As this needs to be an invariant for the write part only, the verifier detects writes and adds a prologue that is calling <strong>bpf_skb_pull_data()</strong> to effectively unclone the <em>skb</em> from the very beginning in case it is indeed cloned.</p>
<p>A call to this helper is susceptible to change the underlaying packet buffer. Therefore, at load time, all checks on pointers previously done by the verifier are invalidated and must be performed again, if the helper is used in combination with direct packet access.</p>

<p>The use of <em>xdp_md</em><strong>-&gt;data_meta</strong> is optional and programs are not required to use it. The rationale is that when the packet is processed with XDP (e.g. as DoS filter), it is possible to push further meta data along with it before passing to the stack, and to give the guarantee that an ingress eBPF program attached as a TC classifier on the same device can pick this up for further post-processing. Since TC works with socket buffers, it remains possible to set from XDP the <strong>mark</strong> or <strong>priority</strong> pointers, or other pointers for the socket buffer. Having this scratch space generic and programmable allows for more flexibility as the user is free to store whatever meta data they need.</p>

<dd><dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>Read the value of a perf event counter, and store it into <em>buf</em> of size <em>buf_size</em>. This helper relies on a <em>map</em> of type <strong>BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY</strong>. The nature of the perf event counter is selected when <em>map</em> is updated with perf event file descriptors. The <em>map</em> is an array whose size is the number of available CPUs, and each cell contains a value relative to one CPU. The value to retrieve is indicated by <em>flags</em>, that contains the index of the CPU to look up, masked with <strong>BPF_F_INDEX_MASK</strong>. Alternatively, <em>flags</em> can be set to <strong>BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU</strong> to indicate that the value for the current CPU should be retrieved.</p>
<p>This helper behaves in a way close to <strong>bpf_perf_event_read</strong>() helper, save that instead of just returning the value observed, it fills the <em>buf</em> structure. This allows for additional data to be retrieved: in particular, the enabled and running times (in <em>buf</em><strong>-&gt;enabled</strong> and <em>buf</em><strong>-&gt;running</strong>, respectively) are copied. In general, <strong>bpf_perf_event_read_value</strong>() is recommended over <strong>bpf_perf_event_read</strong>(), which has some ABI issues and provides fewer functionalities.</p>
<p>These values are interesting, because hardware PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) counters are limited resources. When there are more PMU based perf events opened than available counters, kernel will multiplex these events so each event gets certain percentage (but not all) of the PMU time. In case that multiplexing happens, the number of samples or counter value will not reflect the case compared to when no multiplexing occurs. This makes comparison between different runs difficult. Typically, the counter value should be normalized before comparing to other experiments. The usual normalization is done as follows.</p>
<pre><code>normalized_counter = counter * t_enabled / t_running</code></pre>
<p>Where t_enabled is the time enabled for event and t_running is the time running for event since last normalization. The enabled and running times are accumulated since the perf event open. To achieve scaling factor between two invocations of an eBPF program, users can can use CPU id as the key (which is typical for perf array usage model) to remember the previous value and do the calculation inside the eBPF program.</p>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>For socket policies, apply the verdict of the eBPF program to the next <em>bytes</em> (number of bytes) of message <em>msg</em>.</p>
<p>For example, this helper can be used in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single <strong>sendmsg</strong>() or <strong>sendfile</strong>() system call contains multiple logical messages that the eBPF program is supposed to read and for which it should apply a verdict.</li>
<li>An eBPF program only cares to read the first <em>bytes</em> of a <em>msg</em>. If the message has a large payload, then setting up and calling the eBPF program repeatedly for all bytes, even though the verdict is already known, would create unnecessary overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>When called from within an eBPF program, the helper sets a counter internal to the BPF infrastructure, that is used to apply the last verdict to the next <em>bytes</em>. If <em>bytes</em> is smaller than the current data being processed from a <strong>sendmsg</strong>() or <strong>sendfile</strong>() system call, the first <em>bytes</em> will be sent and the eBPF program will be re-run with the pointer for start of data pointing to byte number <em>bytes</em> <strong>+ 1</strong>. If <em>bytes</em> is larger than the current data being processed, then the eBPF verdict will be applied to multiple <strong>sendmsg</strong>() or <strong>sendfile</strong>() calls until <em>bytes</em> are consumed.</p>
<p>Note that if a socket closes with the internal counter holding a non-zero value, this is not a problem because data is not being buffered for <em>bytes</em> and is sent as it is received.</p>

For <strong>sendmsg</strong>() hooks this is likely the first scatterlist element. But for calls relying on the <strong>sendpage</strong> handler (e.g. <strong>sendfile</strong>()) this will be the range (<strong>0</strong>, <strong>0</strong>) because the data is shared with user space and by default the objective is to avoid allowing user space to modify data while (or after) eBPF verdict is being decided.

<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Example usage for most of the eBPF helpers listed in this manual page are available within the Linux kernel sources, at the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>samples/bpf/</em></li>
<li><em>tools/testing/selftests/bpf/</em></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="license">LICENSE</h1>
<p>eBPF programs can have an associated license, passed along with the bytecode instructions to the kernel when the programs are loaded. The format for that string is identical to the one in use for kernel modules (Dual licenses, such as “Dual BSD/GPL”, may be used). Some helper functions are only accessible to programs that are compatible with the GNU Privacy License (GPL).</p>
<p>In order to use such helpers, the eBPF program must be loaded with the correct license string passed (via <strong>attr</strong>) to the <strong>bpf</strong>() system call, and this generally translates into the C source code of the program containing a line similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>char ____license[] __attribute__((section(&quot;license&quot;), used)) = &quot;GPL&quot;;</code></pre>
<h1 id="implementation">IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>This manual page is an effort to document the existing eBPF helper functions. But as of this writing, the BPF sub-system is under heavy development. New eBPF program or map types are added, along with new helper functions. Some helpers are occasionally made available for additional program types. So in spite of the efforts of the community, this page might not be up-to-date. If you want to check by yourself what helper functions exist in your kernel, or what types of programs they can support, here are some files among the kernel tree that you may be interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>include/uapi/linux/bpf.h</em> is the main BPF header. It contains the full list of all helper functions, as well as many other BPF definitions including most of the flags, structs or constants used by the helpers.</li>
<li><em>net/core/filter.c</em> contains the definition of most network-related helper functions, and the list of program types from which they can be used.</li>
<li><em>kernel/trace/bpf_trace.c</em> is the equivalent for most tracing program-related helpers.</li>
<li><em>kernel/bpf/verifier.c</em> contains the functions used to check that valid types of eBPF maps are used with a given helper function.</li>
<li><em>kernel/bpf/</em> directory contains other files in which additional helpers are defined (for cgroups, sockmaps, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Compatibility between helper functions and program types can generally be found in the files where helper functions are defined. Look for the <strong>struct bpf_func_proto</strong> objects and for functions returning them: these functions contain a list of helpers that a given program type can call. Note that the <strong>default:</strong> label of the <strong>switch … case</strong> used to filter helpers can call other functions, themselves allowing access to additional helpers. The requirement for GPL license is also in those <strong>struct bpf_func_proto</strong>.</p>
<p>Compatibility between helper functions and map types can be found in the <strong>check_map_func_compatibility</strong>() function in file <em>kernel/bpf/verifier.c</em>.</p>
<p>Helper functions that invalidate the checks on <strong>data</strong> and <strong>data_end</strong> pointers for network processing are listed in function <strong>bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data</strong>() in file <em>net/core/filter.c</em>.</p>
